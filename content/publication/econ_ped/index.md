This paper describes how cloud computing tools widely used in the instruction of data scientists
can be introduced and taught to economics students as part of their curriculum. The demonstration
centers around a workflow where the instructor creates a virtual server and the students only need
internet access and a web browser to complete in-class tutorials, assignments, or exams. Given how
prevalent cloud computing platforms are becoming for data science, introducing these techniques
into studentsâ€™ econometrics training would prepare them to be more competitive when job hunting,
while making instructors and administrators re-think what a computer laboratory means on campus.
